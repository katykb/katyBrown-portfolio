### Description
      This is a react application. I have created a single page app that is deployed using gitHub pages.
      Tech used: Font Awesome for React, useState, react-router-dom, Github pages, CSS, JavaScript 
### Usage

### License
      NoLicense
### Contributors
      I would like to thank "Tech2 etc" for this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h2b4ftbZcU. 
      I followed along and was able to create this portfolio, which I think is pretty nice! 
      I am still in the process of making a more unique design as well as trying to get the responsivenes debugged 
      (which occured after my changing some of the original suggustions for the project).
      I recommend this tutorial if you are trying to put together a portfolio or any site really made with React.js.
### Test
      no formal testing. Debugging was done by utilizing the console located in developer tools.
